I am a marketer and fundraiser in Washington, DC, working to advance freedom.

A frequent speaker on fundraising, online marketing, and optimization, I built the Heritage Foundation's online fundraising program. Today I inspire people to give more and more often to the Leadership Institute.

While at Dartmouth College, I served as an editor at *The Dartmouth Review* and earned a degree in government. Getting my MBA from Georgetown University’s McDonough School of Business taught me that the most valuable lessons come from experience.
