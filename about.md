I am an online marketer in my hometown of Washington, D.C.

A frequent speaker on online marketing and optimization, including at the Marketing Sherpa Optimization Summit, the Direct Marketing Association Nonprofit Conference, and the Leadership Institute, I oversee online fundraising at The Heritage Foundation.

Before joining Heritage, I earned a degree in government from Dartmouth College, where I served as an editor at [*The Dartmouth Review*][1]. I also hold a Masters in Business Administration from Georgetown University’s McDonough School of Business.

Opinions expressed on this site are my own.
