Chris Hexton offers four tips to improve how your e-mails perform:

  1. <strong>Write strong subject lines.</strong> You need to be relevant and clear without giving everything away.
  2. **Craft personal e-mails**. That means both using your customer’s name—it really works!—and writing in a friendly, personal style.
  3. **Include a P.S.** People read it, so it’s “a golden opportunity to make sure your customers read the CTA.”
  4. **Be careful with images.** Not everyone’s e-mail program will render your beautiful, image-heavy e-mail, so make sure you have a text fallback.

Remember to test every technique you try, since your audience may be different. And always remember that you can spoil your perfect e-mail with a crappy landing page.
