Google has released [a fascinating new study][1] about how people use their various screens–televisions, phones, tablets, desktops, and so forth–throughout the day.

![Smart phones are the most common starting place for online activities.][2]

[<!--more-->Ingrid Lunden summarizes the study at TechCrunch][3]:

> But, while smartphones may have the shortest sessions <del>be used the least overall</del>, they are the most-used when it comes to on-boarding to a digital experience — or sequential device usage, as Google calls it. The research found that a majority of online tasks get initiated on a smartphone while being continued on another device — perhaps with a larger screen for easier use.

Two key lessons from this:

  1. Optimize your content *for whichever device your customers might be using*.
  2. Go multi-channel: your customers see several screens daily. Make sure you’re visible on as many as possible.
