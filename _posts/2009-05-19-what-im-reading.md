  * [MyLifeIsAverage][1]  
    An amusing response to FML.
  * [The auto industry, now run by the people who brought you the DMV][2]  
    “President Barack Obama took aim at climate-warming greenhouse gases on Tuesday and ordered the struggling auto industry to make more fuel-efficient cars under tough new national standards to cut emissions and increase gas mileage.”
  * [Menu labeling bill introduced by U.S. lawmakers — Los Angeles Times][3]  
    “Two federal lawmakers have introduced legislation to require fast-food and other chain restaurants to post calories on menu boards and food display tags. The chains also would have to put information about calories, fats, carbohydrates and salt on printed menus.”
  * [David Freddoso on the Club for Growth’s political impact][4]  
    “The Wall Street Journal tackles the the Club for Growth, some conservatives’ financial answer to the problem of overwhelming incumbent retention in Congress. The piece, in which some moderates fault the Club for shrinking the GOP caucus, misses two important points.”
