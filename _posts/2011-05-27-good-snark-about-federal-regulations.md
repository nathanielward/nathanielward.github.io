Kevin Williamson [wades into Regulations​.gov and delivers up this commentary][1]:

> The Federal Register, within living memory about the size of a family Bible, today takes up about 30 feet of shelf space.
> 
> Out of these millions of words of small-print lawyerese, Obama’s regulatory czar, Cass Sunstein, has identified about 30 regulations he’d like to see repealed, as part of a review of regulations mandated by an executive order. That’s nice.
