Henry Ward (no relation) explains his principles for hiring an excellent team:

> 1. Hire for Strength vs Lack of Weakness
2. Hire for Trajectory vs Experience
3. Hire Doers vs Tellers
4. Hire Learners vs Experts
5. Hire Different vs Similar
6. Always pass on ego


To find excellent employees, you have to take risks, he argues. "Do not be afraid of hiring False Positives. Give people chances. Be afraid of missing the 20x employee."

His critique of _Built to Last_ and corporate culture is also on point.
