The new culture war “is not a fight over guns, gays or abortion,” Arthur Brooks argues, but [a battle between free enterprise and statism][1]. Supporters of free enterprise need to make a moral case for their system, he writes, to demonstrate that “earned success” is superior to dependence on government, and not simply hold that free enterprise delivers better material results.

Speaking of dependence on government, [the *New York Times* claims][2] that the insufficiency of one government subsidy, for child care, is driving families onto another government subsidy, welfare. However did people cope before government provided everything?

[Renderings of the proposed Purple Line in Maryland][3] show there’s no reason transit has to be ugly (link in PDF). While landscaping may add to the project’s cost, it’s worth remembering that aesthetics matter and that there’s a difference between lowering costs and cutting corners.

The Atlantic is running a [special report on the changing American city][4]. Every article is worth a read. Progressives have for too long dominated debates over urban policy; it behooves conservatives to engage this debate head-on and offer real solutions to problems facing cities.

And last but not least, [Google has announced][5] it will make its Pac-Man doodle [permanently available][6].
