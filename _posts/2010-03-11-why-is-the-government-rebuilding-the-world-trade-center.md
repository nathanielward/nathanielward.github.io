New York Mayor Mike Bloomberg and Sheldon Silver, the speaker of the New York State Assembly, [argue in today’s New York Times][1] that the World Trade Center “redevelopment process was always intended to be a public-private collaboration.” They urge the Port Authority, the public agency that owns the site, to further assist with the project’s finances. Another government agency, the joint city-state [Lower Manhattan Development Corporation][2], is also involved in the redevelopment.

Aside from mere symbolism, however, why should taxpayer money be spent to plan and construct a private office building that fairly clearly nobody wants to build? After all, if there were really demand for a 100-story skyscraper, then private financing would be forthcoming.
