Engage’s Patrick Rufini has put together [a thorough analysis of the Obama campaign’s technology efforts][1].

Drawing on data from public sources and private briefings, the 93-page report covers:

  * How the campaign structured itself to directly integrate its online and data analysis teams, including its hiring practices;
  * The innovative techniques the campaign used to measure, analyze, and model its supporters and the electorate;
  * What the campaign did to optimize its online fundraising, including A/​B testing, so it could meet its $1 billion fundraising goal;
  * The campaign’s use of custom-built technology tools and cloud-based services to give itself an edge over Mitt Romney; and
  * How social media and online advertising played a big role in reaching voters and bringing them to the polls.

The report (behind a registration wall) is definitely worth your time.
