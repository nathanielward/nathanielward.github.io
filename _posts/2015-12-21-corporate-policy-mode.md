When Jason Fried ran out of contacts while traveling, he went to a Target eye clinic. Instead of being a stickler for policy---Fried's contact lens prescription had technically expired---Ron from Target simply gave him a set of trial lenses at no charge.

> Ron is a very reasonable man. He considered the situation, considered the risk, and did the reasonable thing. He helped someone out who was stuck in a bind. He imagined what it would be like if he was in my shoes, and I was behind the desk instead. He’d want from me what I asked of him. That’s the best service you can ever give.

> It made me think about our business. We should be Ron. **We all should be more like Ron.**Snap out of corporate policy mode, and act under the good neighbor code.

Emphasis in the original.

Whether you run an eye clinic or a software startup or a nonprofit, the role of customer service is the same: to solve the customer's problem. It doesn't really matter if you caused the problem. What's important is that you fix it. Your customers will remember you fondly if you do---and feel bitter towards you if you don't.
