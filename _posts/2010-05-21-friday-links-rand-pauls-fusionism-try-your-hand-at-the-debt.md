Kentucky Senate candidate Rand Paul, son of Rep. Ron Paul (R-TX), won the Republican primary on Tuesday in part by [smoothing over differences with traditional conservatives][1], as David Weigel explains. Can this new, libertarian-leaning fusionism prevail in November?

Paul seems to have already [gotten himself in some trouble][2] for his  remarks about the Civil Rights Act. Mark Tapscott warns that the liberal-leaning media is [likely to jump all over such rookie mistakes][3].

Cautioning that Paul’s particular brand of conservatism may not be viable outside Kentucky, [Daniel Larison outlines the younger Paul’s political beliefs][4]:

> First of all, Paul is one of a very few Republican candidates in the country who is truly serious in his desire for fiscal responsibility. In his hostility to expansive government and reckless spending, he does not make exceptions for military spending, and he is appropriately skeptical of government power whether it comes in the form of military adventurism and empire-building or sweeping social legislation and bailouts.

Speaking of sweeping legislation, [the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget offers a budget simulator][5] that challenges you to push the federal debt under 60 percent of GDP by 2018. It’s curious that many (though not all) of its fixes amount to fiddling around the edges, where more substantial reforms, like tax simplification or paring back of whole spending programs, may be more appropriate. Special challenge: win the game without imposing onerous new taxes!
