Seth Godin says non-profits need to be more innovative, which means they need to be more willing to accept failure:

> Go fail. And then fail again. Non-profit failure is too rare, which means that non-profit innovation is too rare as well. Innovators understand that their job is to fail, repeatedly, until they don’t.

This is absolutely right. A non-profit group should do everything it can to better advance its mission. That may mean trying new and better ways to be even more effective. Fear of failure is the surest way to maintain the status quo.
