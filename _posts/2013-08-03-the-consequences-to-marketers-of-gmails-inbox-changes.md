The new Gmail inbox design, which diverts marketing e-mails to a separate “Promotions” tab, could pose [a threat to e-mail marketers][1], Jordan Cohen writes.

> While it is still too early to tell what the impact on open and click-through rates will be, marketers are right to be concerned that emails placed in a separate tab will be out of sight, and may also be out of mind (or, in the very least, not top of mind). By last count (June 2012), there were [425 million][2] Gmail users in the world, and it may be up to half a billion by now — so the effect can potentially be substantial.

For now, users’ ability to disable the tabs and the increased use of mobile devices to check e-mail could limit the damage, he adds. Kimbia suggests [a few workarounds][3] as well.

But perhaps the bigger threat is that other providers follow Google in hiding marketing messages from recipients.
