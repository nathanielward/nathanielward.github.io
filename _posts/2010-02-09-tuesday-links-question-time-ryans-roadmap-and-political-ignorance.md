[Peggy Noonan argues][1] that British-style Question Time between lawmakers and the chief executive isn’t what America needs. Why are conservatives on board with this effort at all, save for short-term political reasons? After all, it was progressives like Woodrow Wilson who [argued our Constitution should be more British][2].

Ross Douthat says Rep. Paul Ryan’s budget proposal [offers a way forward][3]: “Ryan’s roadmap holds out the possibility of at least some common ground between the limited-government right and the redistributionist left — and long-term solvency into the bargain.” Reihan Salam, meanwhile, [defends Ryan’s plan][4] from its critics on the Left and concludes that it “offers a stable, sustainable course for the welfare state that promises to be far more stable than a centrally directed alternative that burdens the federal government with more complexity than it can successfully manage.”

A Pew quiz shows how [alarmingly ignorant][5] many Americans are of current events, while an ISI study finds that college graduates [can’t answer basic civics questions][6]. Ilya Somin offered a few [thoughts on rational political ignorance][7] back in 2008.

And last but not least, BeyondDC offers up a few reasons [why city-dwellers have it better][8].
