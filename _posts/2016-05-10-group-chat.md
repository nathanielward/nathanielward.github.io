Group chat is a useful tool for work, [Jason Fried writes](https://m.signalvnoise.com/is-group-chat-making-you-sweat-744659addf7d#.6qamjeod6):

> I just don’t think it’s the go-to tool. I think it’s the exception tool. It’s far more useful for special cases than general cases. When used appropriately, sparingly, and in the right context at the right time, it’s great. You just really have to contain it, know when not to use it, and watch behavior and mood otherwise it can take over and mess up a really good thing.

The goal is productivity, not communication for its own sake.
