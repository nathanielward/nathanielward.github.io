Tim Ferriss offers [advice for dealing with online critics][1], much of it based on the axiom that you can’t please all the people all the time.

The Library of Congress’ online catalog includes several [great old pictures of Dupont Circle][2], including this one of the circle before the fountain was installed:

[![Photo Dupont Circle, Washington, D.C. from the Library of Congress](http://lcweb2.loc.gov/service/pnp/det/4a20000/4a23000/4a23100/4a23139r.jpg)][3]

Sean Fieler and Jeffrey bell ask whether we should [revisit the gold standard][4] as one way to rein in runaway government.

Last but not least, [Reihan Salam explores][5] whether legislation to limit ATM fees will be counterproductive. He cites [a fun article on the topic by Thomas Hazlett][6], who sarcastically asks, “can anyone explain why at a price of $0, quantity supplied is nil?”
