I got a coupon in the mail from Chipotle the other day. At the bottom was this fine print:

> Offer valid only at participating locations, which in this case means all locations. Not to be combined with any other offers or somehow cleverly duplicated. Limit one card per visit. Please present this card to the cashier, but don’t be surprised when they keep it. Cash value <sup>1</sup>⁄<sub>100</sub><sup>th</sup> of one cent, which is pretty much nothing. This is the fine print, why are you still reading this? Really, this is getting silly, go eat. © 2012 Chipotle Mexican Grill.

In truth, *every* part of what you send to your customers should be written as if it’s from one human to another. Every detail matters, and it catches your customers’ attention when you break from the routine language. Think about how compelling the Southwest safety announcements are!

Have you seen other examples of companies communicating with their customers in unexpectedly human ways? Tell me in the comments.
