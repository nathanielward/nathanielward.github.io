Design, like all aspects of marketing, should serve a business need. Too often, this doesn't happen, Paul Adams writes:

>Too many designers are designing to impress their peers rather than address real business problems. This has long been a problem in creative advertising (where creative work is often more aligned with winning awards than with primary client business objectives) and it’s becoming more prominent in product and interaction design.
