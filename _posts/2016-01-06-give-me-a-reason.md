I was shopping around online recently for a finance app. Nearly every app's website listed the same set of features: I can import transactions from my bank; I can set budgets; I can use a mobile app.

Almost none of the apps' websites explained *why their product was better than the other guy's*. They didn't distinguish themselves on reliability, trustedness, ease of use, popularity, or much else.

This left me lost, and forced me into time-consuming demos and trials when some sharp marketing could have sealed the deal a lot sooner.

[Peep Laja says it better than I could.](http://conversionxl.com/why-buy-from-you-and-not-the-other-guys-rant/) He explains that lots of customers are like me: they shop around. Not only that,

> sometimes they compare 10+ websites before deciding where to buy from. (The only exception seems to be users part of [loyalty programs,](http://conversionxl.com/customer-retention-strategy/) such as Amazon Prime, hotel rewards memberships, etc.)

>Yet, so many websites don’t list a single reason to buy from them.

>Everyone’s got problems, and people are generally busy and superficial. They’re not reading everything on your website, [instead they’re scanning](http://conversionxl.com/write-copy-people-read/). If it’s not explicit why they should buy from you, the competitor who makes it clear wins.

It's not about listing your features or your benefits as such. It's about explaining why what you're selling is the best possible use of my money right now.
