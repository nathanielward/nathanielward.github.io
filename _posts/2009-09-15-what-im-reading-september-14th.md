  * [Class Warfare.][1] Responding to hard times, governments around the world decide not to tighten their belts but to increase their revenues through punitive taxes.
  * [Is This Really a Compromise?][2] The Baucus proposal addresses superficial concerns but doesn’t address the principal conservative complaint about the Left’s health care plan: that it vastly increases the size and scope of the federal government.
  * [Norman Podhoretz on Why Jews are Liberals.][3] “[I]n virtually every instance of a clash between Jewish law and contemporary liberalism, it is the liberal creed that prevails for most American Jews. Which is to say that for them, liberalism has become more than a political outlook. It has for all practical purposes superseded Judaism and become a religion in its own right.”
  * [Tyler Cowen on Politics and the Economy.][4] “But we are now injecting politics ever more deeply into the American economy, whether it be in finance or in sectors like health care. Not only have we failed to learn from our mistakes, but also we’re repeating them on an ever-larger scale.”
