There’s a powerful force keeping your supporters from giving you money online: friction.

Tim Kachuriak, Dan Gillett, and I will tell you how to identify friction and how to limit its effects on April 8 at the [Association of Fundraising Professionals 2013 International Conference in San Diego][1].

Here’s the event description:

> Friction can be described as anything that causes psychological resistance to a given element on a web page. And if you took a good look at your online donation page, you’ll find it is riddled with it. This entertaining workshop will help you to identify the donation-killing friction on your web site and implement strategies to limit it.
