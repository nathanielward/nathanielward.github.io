Cara Harshman explains a test the Romney campaign ran:

> The team started optimizing for  donations with a test on the main call-to-action in the right upper corner of the homepage. They wanted to see whether button color – blue, green, yellow or red – and word choice – “Contribute,” “Support”, or “Donate” – impacted the likelihood of a visitor to click.
> 
> Overall they found that color did not have a definitive impact, but the word “Contribute” did show a statistically significant improvement of 10%.
