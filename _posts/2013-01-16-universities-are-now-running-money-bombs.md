Columbia University ran a one-day online fundraising campaign that drew $6.9 million. It had all the hallmarks of a political-style money bomb:

  * A time-limited campaign to create urgency;
  * Matching gifts from major contributors to inspire donations;
  * A counter showing funds raised to date;
  * Donations before the formal campaign launch to generate momentum; and
  * Multi-channel promotion via e-mail, social media, and phones.

I’m particularly intrigued by the university’s use of a contest between its component schools to prompt donors to give more.
