Survey Monkey crunched the data:

> Response rates were highest for survey invitations sent out on Monday, and lowest for invitations sent on Friday. On average, surveys sent out on Mondays received 10% more responses than average, and surveys sent out on Fridays received 13% fewer responses than average.

But don’t assume these results hold true for your list, and the full post has lots of caveats. Test!
