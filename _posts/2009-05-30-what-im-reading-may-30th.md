  * [The Financial Crisis, Free Markets, and the Nirvana Fallacy.][1] David Bernstein on whether it really was the absence of regulation that precipitated the financial crisis.
  * [Tax ‘Loopholes.’][2] The idea that Delaware holding companies offer a “tax loophole” depriving states of tax revenues is premised on the dubious notion that a government has some “rightful” claim to part of a private firm’s earnings.
  * [David Brooks on the New Public-Private Partnerships.][3] “These events have heralded a new era of partnership between the White House and private companies, one that calls to mind the wonderful partnership Germany formed with France and the Low Countries at the start of World War II.”
  * [NRSC Angering Online Base][4] Work with your online supporters, don’t alienate them.
