  * Why cities that people actually want to live in [aren’t counted as “liveable” cities][1].
  * Progressives are wrong, Burt Folsom explains: [early Christians’ social compact was about private charity][2], not government redistribution.
  * A neat infographic shows how [long load times can drive website visitors away][3].
  * Do [sanctimonious op-eds][4] about why atheists are better help atheists’ public image?
  * How [the minimum wage increases unemployment][5].
  * Last but not least, Alex Tabarrok reports that the federal government is finally [starting to sell off some of its assets][6]. Uncle Sam owns fully 30 percent of the country’s land area.
