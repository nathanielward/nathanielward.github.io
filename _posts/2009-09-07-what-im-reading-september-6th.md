  * [What Washingtonians Make.][1] 
  * [The Cupcake Boom.][2] 
  * [Mitch Daniels Explains the Need for Fiscal Responsibility in the States.][3] “The coming state government reset will be particularly wrenching after the happy binge that preceded this recession. During the last decade, states increased their spending by an average of 6% per year, gusting to 8% during 2007-08. Much of the government institutions built up in those years will now have to be dismantled.”
  * [The Tories’ Privatization Scheme.][4] It sounds like a fine idea, but the justification is a bit odd. Aren’t there better reasons to privatize government-run industries other than short-term revenue gains? I hope and expect the Conservatives are making this point.
