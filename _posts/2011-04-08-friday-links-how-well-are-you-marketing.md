  * Loren McDonald asks [if e-mail marketers are sending too many messages][1] and offers some ways you can tell if you’re over-sending.
  * Target Analytics has released its [2011 index of non-profit fundrasing performance][2], based on 83 organizations. Roger Craver wants to know [what these organizations’ direct marketers are doing wrong][2].
  * You thought America had a real estate bubble? China’s central planners have built [whole *cities*][3] that now lie empty. [Via Tim Cavanaugh][4].
  * Dan Mitchell passes on a [slightly bawdy joke about unions][5].
  * Last but not least, Pierre LeBrun argues that Alex Ovechkin’s diminished numbers this year reflect [a player newly committed to team victory][6] over personal success. The Capitals, perhaps not coincidentally, have [clinched the Southeast division][7] for the fourth straight year.
