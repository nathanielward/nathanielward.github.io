[Here’s a cool story about how using social media for customer service][1] created a happy customer and generated positive earned media for Samsung Canada. The company treated Shane Bennett as an individual and reaped the rewards. I wouldn’t be surprised if this earned Samsung a customer for life and a lot of public goodwill.

This follows the playbook Dave Kerpen outlines in [Likeable Social Media][2], which argues that this sort of public customer service is exactly how to use social media. Kerpen’s book is a must-read for those looking to take their social media programs to the next level.
