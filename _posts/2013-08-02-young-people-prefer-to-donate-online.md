This, from [a survey of young donors][1], should come as no surprise:

> The donors also prefer to give online, with 84 percent saying they want to give through a Web site. The second most-popular way to give, with only 48 percent of donors, was to make a donation in person at an event.

It’s yet another reason to make sure you have a solid website and an easy-to-use online donation process.

But don’t rework your fundraising program just yet. The real question is not what young people claim about their giving behavior—[people have a tendency to lie about such things][2] on surveys—but whether they actually give at all.
