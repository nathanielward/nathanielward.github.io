Rich Lowry flags this as the “[scariest passage][1]” in President Obama’s [address to the Congress][2] (emphasis added):

> As soon as I took office, I asked this Congress to send me a recovery plan by President’s Day that would put people back to work and put money in their pockets. **Not because I believe in bigger government — I don’t.** Not because I’m not mindful of the massive debt we’ve inherited – I am. I called for action because the failure to do so would have cost more jobs and caused more hardships. In fact, a failure to act would have worsened our long-term deficit by assuring weak economic growth for years. That’s why I pushed for quick action.

Lowry may be right that this is politically shrewd rhetoric, since it allows the President “to redefine extensive government activism as simple pragmatism” and potentially redefine the national debate on the size and scope of government. But this is hardly a new argument, however.

Progressives have long couched their arguments for a larger government role as pragmatic responses to the weakness of private, individual action. They do not contend that we need bigger government as such, but instead maintain that since individual action is insufficient to achieve “socialy desirable” ends,  the only viable alternative is government action. Herbert Croly, for instance, [argued a century ago][3] that the unequal distribution of wealth was “the inevitable outcome of the chaotic individualism of our political and economic organization.” And since individualism has failed, the pragmatic alternative is for the federal government to “mak[e] itself responsible for a morally and socially desirable distribution of wealth.”
