Patrick Ruffini says the GOP needs to focus on what works, not what consultants *say* works. And that requires a new mindset:

> Operatives — even digital ones — need to be willing to subject everything they do to randomized experiments to show what’s working and what isn’t. (If we did, we’d likely never hear another GOTV robocall again.) The top performers may not be the ones who hit on the first try — but those who can tweak and adjust to achieve the best result over the long run. In a political industry known for its brashness, the key to success moving forward may be an introspective and intellectually curious mindset that comes with constant testing and refinement.
