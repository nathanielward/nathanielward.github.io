  * Which Alex Semin will show up in the playoffs? I hope it’s [this one][1].
  * Hard work is passé, Hamilton Nolan writes. He suggests Americans [not work one minute over eight hours a day][2]. I can’t express how much I disagree.
  * Ronald Bailey suggests that even the wisest bureaucrats might not be able to resist [the human temptation to overreact to perceived risks][3].
  * Brian Clark argues that [concise writing and effective writing may be at odds][4].
  * [Is there really a wage gap][5] between men and women?
  * Last but not least, the District of Columbia is [taking land from private landowners][6] and giving it to a private developer who will use it for politically-approved purposes.
