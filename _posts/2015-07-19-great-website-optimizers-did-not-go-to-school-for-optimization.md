[Brian Massey, quoted by Peep Laja][1]:

> Great website optimizers can be found in the most unusual of places, because they are currently among the most unusual of individuals. Great website optimizers did not go to school for optimization. They are grown, not found. They can be found in libraries and in psychology schools. They tend bees, arrange flowers, and any other number of hobbies that involve visual differential analysis.

The whole thing is worth a read if you’re testing online.
