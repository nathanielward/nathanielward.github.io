Jonathan Adler argues that [many self-described followers of Edmund Burke are anything but][1]: “The institutions [David] Brooks would defend today bear no resemblance to the organic institutions Burke sought to protect.  Indeed, they have crowded out and, in some cases crushed, the little platoons upon which social order depends.  So the meaningful question for a true Burkean is not whether to oppose a Jacobin revolution, but what to do after such a revolution has already taken place.”

In the latest issue of *A List Apart*, Ethan Marcotte explains [how to use CSS style sheets to create a web site that scales well][2] to varying screen resolutions. For example, he uses CSS media queries to create a single page that renders well on an iPhone, on a standard monitor and on a wide-screen monitor. I’ve implemented some of his techniques on this page to make an iPhone-friendly version.

Europe’s “[current welfare state is unaffordable][3]…The crisis has made the day of reckoning closer by several years in virtually all the industrial countries.”

And last but not least, Google has [made several excellent fonts available for free use][4] on other sites through a simple CSS call. [OFL Sorts Mill Goudy TT][5] is now the default font for this site.
