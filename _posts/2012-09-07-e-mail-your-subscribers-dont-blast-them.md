Are your e-mail subscribers human beings?

This sounds like a stupid question. But way too many e-mail marketers treat their subscribers as an anonymous mass of people to bombard with “e-mail blasts.”

This unfortunate term in e-mail marketing, “blast,” just refuses to go away. It calls to mind one-size-fits-all messaging, sent without regard for what your subscribers want. It suggests you want to send every subscriber an impersonal message about something that’s important to you, not something important to him. That’s an organization-focused approach to marketing, where the message is about you and not about the recipient.

And ultimately, blasting away will lead your subscribers to tune you out. You’ll just churn and burn through your list.

But there’s a better way. It’s harder and more complicated, but in the end it’s more rewarding.

Put yourself in your subscriber’s shoes. Think about what he wants and what interests him, and attempt to establish a relationship by asking his opinion and sending him relevant, personalized messages. Consider why he subscribed in the first place: because you offer something valuable to him.

So stop talking about sending “blasts.”

**What do you think? Is “blast” a harmless shorthand or does it reflect a counterproductive mindset?**
