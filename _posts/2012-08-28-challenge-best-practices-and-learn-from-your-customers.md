Daniel Burstein [posts a video from my talk at the 2012 Optimization Summit](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxUxxdDzm5U).

Here’s [Burstein’s summary on the Marketing Experiments blog][1]:

>   * Put yourself in your customer’s shoes
>   * Try testing unbranded microsites that tap into your customers’ motivations and are focused on engaging your audience before you send them to your conversion goal (Can help with viral marketing)
>   * Challenge best practices with testing

**What best practices do you think need challenging?**
