In its editorial attacking Republican governors for not accepting certain strings-laden federal “stimulus” funds, the New York Times argues that rejecting these monies [retards the march of progress][1]: “But even if new taxes are required at some point, the new federal standards would protect more unemployed workers than ever before and bring states like Louisiana, Mississippi and Texas into the 21<sup>st</sup> century.”

This is a wholly Progressive argument, reminiscent of Croly. Even if the states have to cede authority to the federal government, the argument goes, expanding the federal welfare state is both an absolute good and the logical next step for “modern” government. To reject this enlightened policy, then, even in the name of higher ideals like individual self-worth or protection of state prerogatives, is callous and, worse, backwards.
