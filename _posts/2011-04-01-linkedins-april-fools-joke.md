![LinkedIn's 2011 April Fool's Joke](/images/2011-04-01_LinkedIn.png)

Technology firms have often used April 1 as a chance to play pranks on their customers. Google, for example, is [famous for these hoaxes][1], to the point that its 2004 launch of Gmail (on April 1) was [originally viewed as a joke][2].

In a [crowded field of 2011 pranks][3] that includes elaborate videos and even browser extensions, [LinkedIn][4]’s prank is perhaps the subtlest and thus the funniest. They added historical figures and fictional characters to their “people you may know” tool, including Albert Einstein, Robin Hood (“Activist/​ Chief Fundraiser at Nottingham”) and J. R. R. Tolkien. Unfortunately, you can’t actually add these people to your network, but it’s a fun gesture nonetheless.
