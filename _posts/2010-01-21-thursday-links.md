Good news: The Supreme Court has [struck down government restrictions on free speech][1]. Here’s a quick [history of such restrictions][2] and why they haven’t worked.

Bad news: [America’s economy is less free][3] now than it was a year ago.

The Agitator makes the case that donations in response to disaster [don’t constitute fundraising as such][4].

Daniel Larison asks a good question: are illiberal governments [necessarily a threat][5] to free governments?
