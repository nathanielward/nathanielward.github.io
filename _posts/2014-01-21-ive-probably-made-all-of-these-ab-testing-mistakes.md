Peep Laja identifies [eleven common A/​B testing mistakes][1] (his headline says twelve, but the article is missing a ninth item):

  1. A/​B tests are called early
  2. Tests are not run for full weeks
  3. A/​B split testing is done even when they don’t even have traffic (or conversions)
  4. Tests are not based on a hypothesis
  5. Test data is not sent to Google Analytics
  6. Precious time and traffic are wasted on stupid tests
  7. They give up after the first test fails
  8. They don’t understand false positives
  9. They’re running multiple tests at the same time with overlapping traffic
 10. They’re ignoring small gains
 11. They’re not running tests at all times

In my experience, the first, fourth, and tenth mistakes are easiest to make. I’ve made them myself in my impatience to get a result, my desire to just “try something,” or my desire for a big lift.

But cutting corners to get a big lift as quickly as possible doesn’t teach you anything you can use in the future—and learning is the most valuable takeaway from any test.
