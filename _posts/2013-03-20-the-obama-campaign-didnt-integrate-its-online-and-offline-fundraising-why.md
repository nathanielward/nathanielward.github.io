It has become almost a mantra among fundraisers: integrating your online and offline fundraising yields higher returns.

In my experience at Heritage, coördinating our direct mail and e-mail appeals brings in more money from both the online *and* the offline channels. This tracks with what Convio has found in its [nonprofit benchmark reports][1] (link in <span class="caps">PDF</span>).

But the Obama campaign, famous for testing every element of its work, did very little to integrate its online and offline efforts. That’s [according to Steve Diagneault][2], who reports that “they hardly integrated with snail mail”:

> The online program was mostly a separate entity from the direct mail stream. They used some of the same basic branding and content, but, by and large the channels were optimized to raise the most revenue possible, and that meant not integrating the details.

Does this mean the campaign didn’t even *try* to integrate its direct mail and online channels? Or that they tested it and found integration not to be worth the trouble?
