  * [Mark Steyn on the Birthers.][1] “A true conspiracy theorist would surely believe that Obama deliberately started the birth-certificate business in order to make it easier to dismiss his opponents as deranged.”
  * [A Time for Choosing, Redux.][2] “For centrists in both parties the moment has come to decide which side of the public-private divide they want the U.S. and its future workers to be on.”
  * [Can the Fed Prevent Bubbles?][3] The new president of the New York Federal Reserve, Donald Luskin writes, “thinks the Fed should be responsible for identifying and preventing asset-price bubbles. Considering that the Fed’s track record reveals more skill at causing bubbles than preventing them, this is a very dangerous idea.”
