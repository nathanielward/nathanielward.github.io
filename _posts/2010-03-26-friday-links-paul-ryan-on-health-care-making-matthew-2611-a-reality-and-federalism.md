Rep. Paul Ryan has an important article in the *New York Times* [making the case not only for repealing Obamacare but for replacing it][1]. “It is not sufficient,” he argues, “for those of us in the opposition to await a reversal of political fortune months or years from now before we advance action on health care reform.” To build a system that puts patients first, not bureaucrats, he favors “attaching tax benefits to the individual rather than the job” and enabling state-based reforms like risk pools to manage pre-existing conditions.

The government seems determined to enforce [Matthew 26:11][2]. A new poverty metric would count as poor not those living in real destitution but those living in [relative destitution][3].

In the Washington Post, Brian Frosh and Jamie Raskin argue that if progressives want to undo the effects of *Citizens United*—a bad idea, to be sure—they [ought to turn to the states][4], which retain broad regulatory powers.  (Full disclosure: Brian is a cousin.)

And last but not least, an amusing video of [President George W. Bush wiping his hand on his predecessor](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oHOUnQ0gYI).
