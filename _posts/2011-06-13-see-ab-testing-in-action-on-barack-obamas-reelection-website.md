It’s always interesting to see A/​B testing in action.

In 2008, the Obama campaign [tested the creative used on its website splash pages][1] to maximize e-mail sign-ups and donations.

President Obama’s reelection campaign is doing the same thing. When you visit BarackObama​.com today, you are automatically redirected to one of several splash pages, each of which has a different layout or call to action.

## [Variant 1: Campaign button][2]

This simple landing page, decorated with a campaign button, asks site visitors a simple question and invites e-mail signup. If they do not wish to sign up, visitors are offered a bail-out link to the main campaign website.

## [Variant 2: Are you in?][3]

This simple landing page is like Variant 1, only with the campaign logo in place of the button.

## [Variant 3: Are you in?—with the President][4]

A twist on Variant 2, this page includes a large photo of President Obama overlaid in front of the signup form.

## [Variant 4: 2012 starts here—I’m in][5]

This page swaps out the “Are you in?” question for a statement.

## [Variant 5: 2012 starts here—let’s go][6]

Continuing the evolution begun in Variant 4, this one replaces the submission button text so it reads “let’s go!”

## [Variant 6: Fired up?—let’s go][7]

This next variant again changes the main call to action, once again asking visitors a question.

## [Variant 7: Are you in?—no bailout][8]

This one returns to the simplicity of Variant 2, but drops the “continue to website” bailout link that allows visitors to skip this splash page.

## [Variant 8: Sign up][9]

Variant 8 tests some drier but perhaps more effective copy: “sign up for campaign updates” with a generic “submit” button. Sometimes being straightforward is best.

## [Variant 9: Be the first to know][10]

This landing page variant makes site visitors an offer of exclusive information: “be the first to know.” The submission button now reads “sign up.”

## [Variant 10: Help build this campaign][11]

Variant ten, in turn, appeals to visitors’ belief in the campaign’s mission and invites them to “help build this campaign.” The “from the ground up” and “join us” language suggests a certain exclusivity.

## [Variant 11: Are you in?—photo background][12]

This is a very different take on the landing page, including a large photo of the President and a much smaller signup form using language from Variant 2.

## [Variant 12: Are you in?—photo background, take 2][13]

Modifying Variant 12 slightly, this version includes the exclusive offer also seen in Variant 9.

## [Variant 13: Are you in?—photo background, take 3][14]

Another take on Variant 11, this one repeats Variant 8’s to-the-point “sign up for campaign updates.”
