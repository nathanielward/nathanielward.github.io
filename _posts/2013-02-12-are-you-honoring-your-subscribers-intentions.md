"Just because someone has signed up to your service doesn’t mean they have agreed to receive email from you,” Paul Boag writes.

> This is an important distinction. As part of the sign-up process, you may have indicated that you will email them, or you may have even provided an option for them to opt out. However, if the user didn’t spot this, then you will still alienate them, despite being entirely within your rights. The email is still unsolicited in their eyes.”
