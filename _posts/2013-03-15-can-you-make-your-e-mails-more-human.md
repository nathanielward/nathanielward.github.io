Nathanael Yellis [asks an important question][1]: “why not make your organization’s emails more like the emails you send to your friends and colleagues?”

He’s right. There’s really no good reason not to do that.

Here are a few ways you can strengthen your organization’s e-mails to make them livelier, more interesting, and more personal:<!--more-->

  * **Include a salutation**. Open your e-mails with a greeting: “Dear Jim,” or “Rebecca –.” That’s how you open your messages to your friends, right?
  * **Write your e-mails to one person**. Remember, it’s an individual receiving your e-mail. Especially if you’re using a salutation, write to one person, not a group. Avoid at all costs language like “all of you” that’s addressed to a group. If it helps, keep one recipient in mind as you write.
  * **Be casual**. Nobody writes an e-mail like they do a formal letter. So you shouldn’t either. Use short sentences and short paragraphs. When appropriate for clarity, break grammatical rules: start a sentence with a conjunction or end with a proposition.
  * **Use simple e-mail templates**. Avoid the temptation to make e-mail templates pretty. Remember, an over-designed e-mail not only seems impersonal but may distract your readers from your message’s goal, whether it’s clicking or even just reading your content.

**What else? What other elements can help make your e-mail marketing more human?**
