Are you basing your online marketing plans on the latest benchmark study? What on earth for?

A.G. Lafley and Roger Martin explain why this is foolish in *[Playing to Win][1]:*

> Every industry has tools and practices that become widespread and generic. Some organizations define strategy as benchmarking against competition and then doing the same set of activities but more effectively. Sameness isn’t strategy. It is a recipe for mediocrity.

Benchmark studies can be interesting sources of inspiration and ideas. But they’re not a how-to manual, and you certainly shouldn’t measure yourself against them. You should be doing what’s best for your audience, not aping what your competitors are doing with theirs.

As Flint McLaughlin puts it, “best practices on the internet are typically pooled ignorance.”
