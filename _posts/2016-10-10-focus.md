How do you remain focused and productive in a world full of distractions? Here's how I do it:

- **Use a task management system** like the [Getting Things Done framework](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Getting_Things_Done). Getting your to-do list out of your head and into a list or an app like [Todoist](https://www.todoist.com/) can help you declutter your mind and prioritize what's important.

- **Take notes about everything**. Jotting down a few ideas during or after every meeting will help you focused, organize your thoughts, and keep track of important information. Using an app like Apple's Notes or [Evernote](https://evernote.com) will make your notes searchable in the future.

- **Turn off device notifications**. All of them, on all devices. I only allow notifications for texts, phone calls, and calendar reminders, and then only on my phone. Very little is so important that it requires a chirp or a buzz or a visual alert when you're in the zone.

- **Dedicate time to your priorities**. If something is important, even something that's not "work" like exercise, devote time specifically to its completion. Use your calendar to reserve the time so people don't schedule you. And when you're working, use a timer like [Tadam](http://tadamapp.com/) to help maintain focus.

- **Start projects early**. Start working on a project immediately upon receiving it, while it's top of mind. Your initial inspiration, even if it's just notes jotted down, will serve you well when you're under the gun.

- **Turn down unnecessary meetings**. Other people don't control your time. You do. If you have something to do that's more important than attending the meeting, politely decline.
