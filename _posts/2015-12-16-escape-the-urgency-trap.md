"Marketers need to escape the 'urgency trap,'" Flint McLaughlin writes:

> They need to transcend the urgent with the important. And this cannot be achieved with yet another "how-to" series. We need to contemplate; indeed, we need to make contemplation part of our normal work cycle.

Marketing, he argues in his book, *[The Marketer as Philosopher](https://meclabs.com/research/publication/marketer-as-philosopher-flint-mcglaughlin)*, is as much philosophy as it is science. Scientific marketing experiments like A/B testing can give you data about your customer, but only reflection and thought can help you use that data to *understand* your customer. And understanding, not clever tactics, is the key to successful marketing.
