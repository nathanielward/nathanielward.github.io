  * Prioritizing tasks can be hard. Trent Hamm [offers some advice][1] on how to distinguish the important from the merely urgent.
  * Why is your marketing copy not converting? [Copyblogger has some ideas][2].
  * “Every piece of the ‘success story’ of the auto bailout,” [Todd Zywicki argues][3], would “seem to be in error.”
  * [Regulatory capture in reverse][4]: heavily regulated industries are protesting a Florida proposal that would remove licensing requirements for professions like interior design and dance instruction.
  * Timeliness and concision are the keys to successful marketing on Facebook, [Lauren Drell reports][5]. Equally as important: asking your supporters to engage.
  * Last but not least, Readability is [an intriguing new online tool][6] to make long-form online text easier to read in the browser. The Chrome extension is pretty nifty, but I haven’t taken the plunge to purchase the full service.
