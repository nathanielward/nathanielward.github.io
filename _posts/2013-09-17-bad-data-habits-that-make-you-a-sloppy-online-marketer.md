It’s easy for you to fall into bad habits as an online marketer, especially when it comes to data analysis. And your decision-making using misunderstood data may be just as bad as your [decision-making based on gut instinct][1].

The tools you’re given of of little help. They bury the useful data deep in report pages.

My e-mail tool, for example, will tell me how many times a fundraising message was opened or clicked. It requires more work to determine how many donations that message generated and for how much money—and those are the numbers that matter in a fundraising appeal.

Three terrible data practices make [Loren McDonald’s list of a bad online marketing habits][2]:<!--more-->

> **1. Relying on meaningless metrics**: “Process” metrics like opens and clicks are easy to measure and have value, but “output” metrics like conversions and revenue per email measure email effectiveness more accurately and resonate with management.
> 
> **2. Data laziness:** Are you drilling deep into the numbers to gain useful insights — or just scanning the default reports from your email technology? High-level reports and dashboards are great for taking the temperature of your program, but for making decisions and truly understanding your customers, you need to transition to a deeper analytics and business intelligence mindset.
> 
> **3. Benchmarking bunk:** Stop obsessing about the latest benchmark study that claims the average open rate has declined 0.7% over the previous quarter. Hogwash. [“Average” is the new bottom][3]. Benchmark yourself against the best performers, like-minded companies, similar email program types — and, most importantly, against yourself. Then hold yourself accountable for acting on your findings — otherwise, what’s the point?
