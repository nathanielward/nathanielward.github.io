Restaurants choose their prices, menu layouts, and even item descriptions to maximize each table’s value:

> Some restaurants “anchor” prices with a very expensive item that will make everything else look reasonable in comparison.

But if there’s a $100 burger next to it, they’re more likely to buy that $50 steak.
