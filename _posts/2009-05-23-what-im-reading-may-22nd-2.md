  * [The next conservative leadership?][1] “If Republicans are looking to get back their conservative groove, they could do worse than study Minnesota’s budget brawl. Mr. Pawlenty deftly (and amusingly) outmaneuvered his Democratic opposition, not only saving his state from huge tax increases but clearing the way to cut government spending.”
  * [So much for national sovereignty.][2] “Eighteen “phantom” MEPs will be elected on full pay and perks next month despite not being able to start work for up to two years due to Ireland’s rejection of the Lisbon Treaty.”
  * [Thomas Frank on the Gangs of D.C.][3] “What the Gangs of D.C. nearly always represent — and what distinguishes them from a mere troupe, squad or faction — is power, glorious power. Gangs are but a handful and yet they control our fate; they divert the streams of history; and they do so secretly, away from public view.”
