  * Rep. Paul Ryan [makes the case][1] for his 2012 budget. My colleagues at Heritage [give it two cheers][2], and Ross Douthat calls it the “[triumph of policy” over politics][3].
  * E.J. Dionne warns that Ryan’s budget would mark [the end of progressive government][4], which is actually a good thing.
  * [A new report released by the New Organizing Institute][5] both offers insights into e-mail advocacy and explains why careful testing is important.
  * Megan McArdle explains that the complexity of accounting practices means  it’s perhaps [futile to try to design a corporate tax without “loopholes” of any sort][6]. “A corporate income tax,” she writes, “needs to start by calculating income, and as anyone who has ever looked at a corporate financial statement knows, that’s really complicated.”
  * Mark Hemingway points out [the facts about who has received campaign donations][7] post–*Citizens United*. We shouldn’t forget, though, that principle is a better way to make policy than a *cui bono* analysis.
  * Last but not least, Trent Hamm makes the case that your [leisure time should not be spent idly][8]. Leisure time, he writes, “can provide all the space you need to take on personal goals and get involved in things you might not otherwise enjoy.”
