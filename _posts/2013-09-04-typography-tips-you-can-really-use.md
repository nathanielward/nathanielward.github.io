Good typography can make a great text even greater, but it’s often hard to know where to begin.

Fortunately, we have [Matthew Butterick’s *Practical Typography*][1], which includes a summary of [26 useful typography tips][2]. His entire book, which includes discussion of everything from type faces to page layouts, is a great resource and worth a read.
