  * Lydia DePillis says Washington, D.C. needs [a fiscally-conservative alternative to the lefty D.C. Fiscal Policy Institute][1], the only think tank focused on the city’s local government.
  * Are participants in marathons and other event-based fundraisers really donors in the same sense as direct-marketing donors? [Tom Belford says no.][2]
  * Pork Barrel Barbecue has released a barbecue-scented fragrance. [Really.][3]
  * It’s not clear why repairing ill-maintained local transit infrastructure [ought to be a federal responsibility][4].
  * Last but not least, [Conan O’Brien spoke last week at Dartmouth’s commencement](www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmDYXaaT9sA).
