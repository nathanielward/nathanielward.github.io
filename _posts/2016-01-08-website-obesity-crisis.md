Maciej Cegłowski says websites have become too bloated:

> The problem with picking any particular size as a threshold is that it encourages us to define deviancy down. Today’s egregiously bloated site becomes tomorrow’s typical page, and next year’s elegantly slim design. 

> I would like to anchor the discussion in something more timeless. 

> To repeat a suggestion I [made on Twitter,](https://twitter.com/Pinboard/status/653714626857730048) I contend that text-based websites should not exceed in size the major works of Russian literature.

The whole thing is brilliant.
