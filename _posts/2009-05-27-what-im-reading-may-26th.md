  * [Who Is Sonia Sotomayor?][1] 
  * [Chuck DeVore’s Quixotic Attempt to Twitter and Parody-Video His Way Into the U.S. Senate][2] “‘They say the Internet is forever and things I write could be used against me in the future. If Alexander Hamilton and Lincoln lived today, would they be using their technology to get their message across? Yes,’ DeVore declares. ‘What are the Federalist Papers but the technological equivalent in the 1700s of the blogs?’”
  * [In Defense of Distraction.][3] Sam Anderson asks if it’s possible to retain our focus in a distraction-filled modern world–and does it matter? For what it’s worth, this took three sittings to get through.
  * [Not Helping.][4] This Facebook group makes out Republicans or conservatives as sore losers.
  * [The Healthcare-Competitiveness Fallacy][5]
