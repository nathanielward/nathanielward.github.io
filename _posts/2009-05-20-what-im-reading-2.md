  * [Why trains run slower now than they did in the 1920s.][1]  
    Lower demand, more freight and more government regulation conspire to reduce train speeds.
  * [An interview with the old RNC webmaster][2]  
    “What I discovered is technological development cycles will always overlap with campaign cycles, and that’s not conducive to having efficient technology, because when you’re in campaign mode you’re not going to want to deal with alpha or beta products or sit through the development of something that hasn’t been tested.”
  * [Redskins win new legal fight with Indian group][3]  
    Is “the appropriateness of Native American imagery for team names” really a legal question? Perhaps the name and logo are insensitive, but there’s certainly no “right not to be offended.”
  * [Obama administration plans a new regulator for consumer finance.][4]  
    This is certainly ripe for all kinds of overreach, and could easily backfire.
