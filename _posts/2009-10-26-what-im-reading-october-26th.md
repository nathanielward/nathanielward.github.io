  * [Robert Samuelson on the Public Option.][1] “The promise of the public plan is a mirage. Its political brilliance is to use free-market rhetoric (more ‘choice’ and ‘competition’) to expand government power.”
  * [Unlearning the Lessons of State Health Reforms.][2] “Despite these state-level failures, President Barack Obama and congressional Democrats are pushing forward a slate of similar reforms.
