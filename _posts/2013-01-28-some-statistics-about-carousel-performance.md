Erik Runyon compiles some actual data on how people use carousels, including auto-forwarding carousels and those requiring users to click through. His conclusions:

> First, if they’re going to insist on a carousel, they need to include compelling content that not only entices users to click, but can get their attention in the first place. Second, I might suggest keeping the number of features to a maximum of four (or better yet, three), as it appears that as the number of features increases, the click-throughs on sub-features decreases dramatically. Finally, I’d suggest that the subject matter can make a big difference.

The last point is key.
