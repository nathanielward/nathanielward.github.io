  * This may be [one of the best job listings][1] ever posted. Best bit: “our ideal candidate has also cursed out an editor, had spokespeople hang up on them in anger and threatened to resign at least once because some fool wanted to screw around with their perfect lede.”
  * Far from being the malefactors portrayed in the media, Charles and David Koch are [idealists committed to a free society][2], Matthew Continetti reports.
  * Charities’ challenges in getting funds from wireless carriers should serve as a reminder to fundraisers that [text-to-donate remains an immature tool][3].
  * Christie Grennes has launched a [new blog about coupons and money-saving tips][4].
  * Harry Roberts (whose tips I have come to rely on) [interviews Vitaly Friedman of Smashing Magazine][5].
  * It’s sad that it makes news in D.C. when a real estate development moves forward [relying entirely on private tenants][6].
  * Would you buy [standing-room tickets][7] to see the Capitals?
  * Last but not least, [Tim Pawlenty’s PAC released a powerful video earlier in the year](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfkNEq1XioE).
