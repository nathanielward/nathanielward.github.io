“States don’t have rights,” [Stephen Green reminds us][1]. “Individuals do. It’s time we went about the business of restoring those rights, without alienating a huge constituency which suffered too long without them.” Green rightly argues that conservatives’ use of the language of states’ rights is not only muddle-headed but, for historical reasons, tends to associate conservatives with Jim Crow.

Nicola Moore and Eric Heis are undertaking an innovative project to raise youth awareness of federal overspending: they’re making [a video game caled U.O.Me][2]. They’re accepting contributions through mid-August to fund the game’s programming.

Realizing that spending is an issue of growing salience, progressives are rallying around new gimmicks like advanced rescission to bolster their budget-cutter bonafides. [George Will is having none of it][3]: the plan “certainly would not reduce deficit spending: Under the president’s proposal, if Congress kills the projects on the president’s list, the budgetary allocation would not be reduced, so legislators could dream up new things on which to spend the money.”

Timothy Carney, for his part, [wonders if conservatives will look to military budgets][4] as a source of savings.

[E.J. Dionne says it’s ironic][5] that conservatives who decry big government are calling for the federal government to more effectively manage the Gulf oil spill. Dionne, of course, is missing the point: there’s a difference between effective government (or energetic government, as Publius dubbed it in the *Federalist*) and big government. But all too many conservatives allow progressives to make such arguments by advocating for *small *government rather than a *limited *government that undertakes only its core responsibilities.

And last but not least, [this is a clever submission][6] to [Google’s Search Stories][7] campaign:
