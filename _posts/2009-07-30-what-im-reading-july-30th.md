  * [Tax Burden of Top One Percent Now Exceeds That of Bottom 95 Percent.][1] It’s not bad per se that top earners pay more in taxes, but it’s something we should keep in mind as we consider still more tax increases to ensure “the rich” pay their “fair share.”
  * [In Defense of Profits.][2] Yale Law Professor Stephen Carter argues that “high profits are excellent news. When corporate earnings reach record levels, we should be celebrating. The only way a firm can make money is to sell people what they want at a price they are willing to pay. If a firm makes lots of money, lots of people are getting what they want.”
  * [Overdoing the Security Details.][3] Might anonymity more effectively protect our leaders than attention-grabbing security arrangements?
  * [National Review’s Editors Take on Birth Certificate Conspiracy Theorists.][4]
