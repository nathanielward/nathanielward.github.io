Customer service is a critical part of your customers’ interaction with your company. It’s not just about the product you sell.

[Brian X. Chen][1]:

> As it stands, there is no one-stop website to see reliable ratings for customer service. In part, that is probably because customer service can be such a challenge to measure, said Matthew Dixon, an executive at <span class="caps">CEB</span>, a business advisory firm. His studies found that when people have positive customer service experiences, they tend not to share them.

> “But when they’ve been wronged, they literally will tell anybody who will listen,” Mr. Dixon said.

> Mr. Dixon’s studies found that customers stayed loyal to brands that offered hassle-free service interactions. His studies also found that customers were four times as likely to become disloyal to a brand after any service interaction at all — because so many service centers drag out people’s issues.

It seems like a no-brainer that consumers stick with brands offering solid customer service. Apple, which has more than $190 billion in cash, is well known for its Genius Bar, the service stations at Apple stores where customers can seek help directly from the company’s trained technicians. Amazon, the largest online shopping site in the United States, is celebrated for its customer service.
