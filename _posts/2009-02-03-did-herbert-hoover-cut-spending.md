Paul Krugman makes [an astounding assertion in the New York Times][1]:

> Remember, Herbert Hoover … slash[ed] spending and raise[d] taxes in the face of the Great Depression. Unfortunately, that just made things worse.

Hoover “slashed spending”? Um–no. He was hardly a model of fiscal restraint, laissez-faire or anything of the sort.

<caption>Federal spending, 1929 (last Coolidge budget) to 1933 (last Hoover budget)</caption>

| Year | [Federal spending ($ billions)](http://www.usgovernmentspending.com/) |
| --- | --- |
| 1929 | $3.8 |
| 1930 | $4.0 |
| 1931 | $4.1 |
| 1932 | $4.3 |
| 1933 | $5.1 |

That’s a 55% increase in nominal spending during Hoover’s term in office, which was a period of marked deflation. Put another way, spending increased from 4% of GDP to 9% of GDP–a doubling of spending in four years.

Krugman’s not wrong on one thing: Hoover sure did raise tax rates on income.

| Year | [Revenue from taxes ($ billions)](http://www.usgovernmentspending.com/) | [Top tax rate](http://www.truthandpolitics.org/top-rates.php) |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1929 | $4.2 | 24% |
| 1930 | $4.2 | 25 |
| 1931 | $3.4 | 25 |
| 1932 | $2.5 | 63 |
| 1933 | $3.0 | 63 |

Nominal tax revenues collapsed even with Hoover’s higher tax rates (by today’s progressive definition, that means that from 1931 to 1932 he enacted a 25% tax cut). Even with the 160% higher rates, the percent of GDP taken increased just 25%, from 4% to 5% of GDP. Could there be a link between higher tax rates and reduced economic activity and reduced revenue?
