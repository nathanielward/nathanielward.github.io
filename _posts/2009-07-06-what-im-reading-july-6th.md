  * [Do Retraining Programs Work?][1] “Tens of thousands of laid-off workers like Mr. Hutchins have turned to retraining as a lifeline. Yet for all the popularity of these government-financed programs, there are questions about whether they actually work, even as President Obama’s stimulus plan directs $1.4 billion more to retraining and other services for people who have lost their jobs.”
  * [What the Senate Means Today.][2] Judge Posner explores the changed role of the Senate since the Founding and the political ramifications of a filibuster-proof majority.
  * [Is Romney the Early Frontrunner for 2012?][3]
