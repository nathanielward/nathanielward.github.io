"Generations X and Y are far more likely to give online, and as many Baby Boomers say they give online as via direct mail." That’s according to [a new report from Blackbaud][1].

The study also confirms that donors older than 49 are a better target for fundraisers: they represent 69 percent of all charitable giving. Those under 32, meanwhile, give just 11 percent of donations.
