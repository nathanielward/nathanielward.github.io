  * How a cab medallion system is counterproductive: it [introduces artificial scarcity and distorts drivers’ incentives][1].
  * Russ Roberts points out that [Japan’s fuel shortages are no mystery][2] and that the solution isn’t more regulation. Shortages are a result of price controls that keep a scare product artificially inexpensive.
  * Some [fancy CSS work][3] by Josh Brewer yields an [impressive typographic result][4].
  * New York City’s parking “privatization” scheme is [a bad idea that isn’t really privatization at all][5], Stephen Smith argues.
  * Last but not least, Dan Mitchell rounds up [the late-night hosts’ cracks about Libya][6]. My favorite, from Conan: “It’s being reported that Moammar Gadhafi is surrounded by an élite core of female bodyguards. In a related story, Charlie Sheen invaded Libya.”
