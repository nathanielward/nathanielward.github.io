President Obama has [proposed a freeze][1] on discretionary, non-entitlement, non-military, non-emergency federal spending. Yuval Levin says this is “[a welcome tiny first step.][2]” Dan Mitchell [is more skeptical][3].

Newsweek says [neoconservatism is alive and kicking][4].

[CAP responds to *Citizens United*][5]:  “Indeed, with hundreds of billions of dollars of corporate profits at stake every time Congress begins a session, wealthy corporations would be foolish not to spend tens of billions of dollars every election cycle to make sure that their interests are protected.” Of course, it’s the fact that billions are at stake whenever Congress meets that’s the real problem. Ilya Somin, meanwhile, [defends free speech rights][6].

And finally, [Conan O’Brien stays classy][7] in his final Tonight Show.
