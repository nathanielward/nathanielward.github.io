The independent bookstore up the street maintains a well-curated selection, especially of children’s books, and regularly hosts events with authors. I enjoy having a bookstore like this nearby, and I frequently browse.

Yet I find it hard to actually *purchase* books there. Why? Because it’s vastly more expensive than Amazon.

I went in the other day looking for a copy of *Fall*, Neal Stephenson’s latest book. The bookstore sells the book at its list price of $35. [Amazon sells it](https://www.amazon.com/Fall-Dodge-Hell-Neal-Stephenson/dp/006245871X/ref=tmm_hrd_swatch_0?_encoding=UTF8&qid=1565990446&sr=8-4 "Fall on Amazon") for about $13.53. 

Is supporting a local business worth a 160 percent premium?
