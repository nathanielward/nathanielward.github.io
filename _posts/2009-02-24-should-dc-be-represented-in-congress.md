I recently collaborated on two articles about the pending District of Columbia Voting Rights Act of 2009.

1. **[Voting Representation for the District of Columbia: Violating the Framers’ Vision and Constitutional Commands][1]**  

> Lawmakers must reject any legislative proposal granting the residents of the District of Columbia a separate, voting representative in Congress. Providing such a representative would run afoul of a commonsense understanding of the Constitution, the intentions of the Founders, and more than two centuries of interpretation by legislators and the courts.
    
2. **[D.C. Representation: How Congress Promotes the Interests of the District of Columbia][2]**  

> Congress’s latest attempt to grant representation to the District of Columbia by legislative fiat is not only unconstitutional but potentially contrary to the District’s interests.
