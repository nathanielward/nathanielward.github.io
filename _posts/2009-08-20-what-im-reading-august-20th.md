  * [Obama Contradicts Himself on Health Care.][1] “So the health-care status quo needs top-to-bottom reform, except for the parts that “you” happen to like. Government won’t interfere with patients and their physicians, considering that the new panel of experts who will make decisions intended to reduce tests and treatments doesn’t count as government. But Medicare shows that government involvement isn’t so bad, aside from the fact that spending is out of control—and that program needs top-to-bottom reform too.”
  * [Another ‘Public Option.’][2] How government “competition” is wrecking the private student loan industry.
  * [Market Rationing Isn’t Government Rationing.][3] “Using the government’s coercive power to decide the price of something, or who ought to get it, is qualitatively different from the same outcome arising out of voluntary actions in the marketplace.”
