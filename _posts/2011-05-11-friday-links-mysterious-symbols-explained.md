  * Keith Houston’s [Shady Characters][1] offers the secret history of glyphs like the [octothorpe][2] (#), the [interrobang][3] (‽) and the [pilcrow][4] (¶).
  * The Washington Wizards have [new uniforms][5]. It’s about time.
  * Megan McArdle suggests [Groupon isn’t really a good deal for businesses][6], which may explain why deal quality seems to have declined of late.
  * How Rand Paul is [reshaping the debate in the Senate][7] to promote limited government.
  * Last but not least, the Pew Center is the latest group to release [a superficial online quiz][8] that tries to group people politically based on 20 questions. How does it categorize you?
