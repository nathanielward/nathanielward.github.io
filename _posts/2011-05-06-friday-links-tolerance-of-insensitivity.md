  * [Mark Steyn reminds us][1] that “a ‘multicultural’ society needs not sensitivity training but insensitivity training — that’s to say, thicker skins.”
  * This infographic reminds us that [text fundraising is very, very expensive][2]–and that giving is capped at $10 per gift.
  * “Megabus and Coach USA are owned by the British company Stagecoach Group, and they have fundamentally changed the way Americans—especially the young—travel, so much so that[ they may help kill plans for new railroads][3].”
  * Dependency on government continues apace: [1 in 7 Americans use food stamps][4].
  * Last but not least, The EPA has produced a rap about climate change. [Seriously][5].
