  * [Competitive Altruism.][1] This article misses a key point that economists since Adam Smith have understood: “It is not from the benevolence of the butcher the brewer, or the baker that we expect our dinner, but from their regard to their own interest. We address ourselves, not to their humanity, but to their self-love, and never talk to them of our own necessities, but of their advantages.”
  * [VATs Mean Big Government][2] “The income tax system we have today is a nightmarish combination of class warfare and corrupt loopholes. Adding a VAT does not undo any of the damage it imposes. All that happens is that politicians get more money to spend and a chance to auction off a new set of tax breaks to interest groups. That’s good for Washington, but bad for America.”
  * [The Health Care Fight Got Tougher.][3] The Blue Dogs have agreed in principle to a “public option” government-run health insurance provider, one that would “compete” with private sector plans.
