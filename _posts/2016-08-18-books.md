These are four books I finished recently that you should read too:

## 1. [Rework](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0307463745/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=nathward-20&camp=1789&creative=9325&linkCode=as2&creativeASIN=0307463745&linkId=9941dfde45c3c4d594833d591150a504)

*Jason Fried and David Heinemeier Hansson.* Targeted at entrepreneurs, but offering clear lessons to anyone managing a project or team, *Rework* explains that the keys to success are 1) having the right team in place; 2) launching your product; and 3) constantly improving your product.

## 2.  [Girl on the Train](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1594634025/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=nathward-20&camp=1789&creative=9325&linkCode=as2&creativeASIN=1594634025&linkId=d5f739a644c4be06d4e18cfefc448b85)

*Paula Hawkins.* This engaging thriller makes for a good escape from more serious fare.

## 3. [Subliminal](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0307472256/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=nathward-20&camp=1789&creative=9325&linkCode=as2&creativeASIN=0307472256&linkId=f4c38d8fd660683e2a9b052d4416ceca)

*Leonard Mlodinow.* So much of what we do every day is governed not by conscious thought but by our unconscious: automatic processes we don't even know exist. *Subliminal* is an important read for marketers who want to understand human behavior.

## 4. [Children of Monsters](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1594038155/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=nathward-20&camp=1789&creative=9325&linkCode=as2&creativeASIN=1594038155&linkId=1137d2db4ff54968ffd886b102c42c7d)

*Jay Nordlinger.* An absolutely fascinating look at the children of the 20th century's worst dictators.
