  * [Tyler Cowen on Health Care Reform.][1] “The Obama administration is proposing that we start by spending more now so we can spend less later. This runs the risk of becoming the new voodoo economics.”
  * [The Next Urban Renewal Boondoggle.][2] Bulldozing decaying cities may be good policy in some places. But if it’s adopted at the federal level, it could be another in a long line of failed urban renewal policies.
  * [Can Washington Be ‘Hands-Off’ With GM?][3] “Many commentators worry that this new, nationalized GM will answer to politicians rather than profit and loss. They fear that this could lead to a $100 billion quagmire. Their fears are not without reason.”
