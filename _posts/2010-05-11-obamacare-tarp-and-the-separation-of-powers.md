Charles Kesler has an important article in the May 17 issue of *National Review* ([republished online over at Claremont Conservative][1]) on the importance of constitutionalism. The penultimate paragraph highlights the importance of restoring the Constitution to its rightful place:

> In the current crisis, conservative efforts to restore the separation of powers may even be more important than a campaign to shore up federalism. TARP, for example, was an unprecedented delegation of legislative power to the Treasury secretary, of all people. It was a desperate, essentially lawless grant resembling the ancient Roman dictatorship, except that the Romans wisely confined their dictators to six-month terms. Obamacare is a 2,000-page monstrosity that will need thousands, perhaps tens of thousands, of pages of additional regulations before it can operate. These will be issued by more than a hundred new bureaucracies, each a source of unaccountable power wielded over individual Americans. These multiplying centers of petty tyranny will accelerate our transformation from a republic of laws to a corrupt r√©gime of muddled and ever more arbitrary power.
