I recently presented at the Leadership Institute’s Online Fundraising Workshop. As I wrapped up, I offered a list of four sites I often visit to brush up on online marketing and fundraising best practices.

  1. [**The Agitator**](http://www.theagitator.net/). With its analysis of innovative fundraising techniques, marketing studies and psychology, The Agitator provides online fundraisers with excellent food for thought. Authors Tom Belford and Roger Craver frequently remind us, for example in [their recent post on personalized e-mail communication][1], that online marketing follows the same principles as other marketing.
  2. [**Copyblogger**][2]. Copyblogger provides excellent insight into how to write engaging and effective copy for the web, whether for e-mail, blog posts, landing pages or social media. [The series on headline writing][3], for instance, helped redefine how I create copy for the web and for e-mail.
  3. [**Media Post’s E-mail Insider**][4]. Geared more towards advanced users, E-mail Insider is nonetheless a must-read for those trying to raise funds online. Many posts are gems, like [this best-practices checklist][5] that both new and established e-mail program managers can return to again and again.
  4. [**Connection Café**](http://www.connectioncafe.com/). Written by consultants at non-profit software company Convio, Connection Café is geared to online fundraising novices and includes good posts on the basics, like [a list of simple rules for e-mail composition][6].
