  * [Does More Prevention Mean Lower Cost?][1] Not necessarily, argues Mark Steyn.
  * [How Facebook is Gunning for Google (And Killing SEO)][2] 
  * [Echoes of Herbert Croly’s Promise of American Life.][3] “For nearly a century, California offered ordinary people better lives than they could lead perhaps anywhere else in the world. Today, reflecting our intensely stratified, increasingly mobile society, California affords the Good Life only to the most gifted and ambitious, regardless of their background. That’s a deeply undemocratic betrayal of California’s dream—and of the promise of American life.”
