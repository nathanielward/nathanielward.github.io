The “superdistribution” of content online–users can access your content not just on your website but via RSS readers, social media, and orbital content readers–has changed the one-to-many distribution model, David Sleight writes:

> [D]igital content continues to find novel new ways to wander away from its various points of origin. Tools that give users ever more control over formatting, timeshifting, and sharing will continue to proliferate. This steady growth runs directly counter to the simple, one-to-many broadcast model enjoyed by many publishers in the past—one where it was relatively easy for them to control the venue and keep tabs on the conversations happening around their content.
