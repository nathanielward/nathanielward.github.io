  * Municipalities are contracting out various public services like libraries and parking enforcement to private enterprises, and the Washington Post [outlines some of the challenges of this approach][1]. Unfortunately, the Post inaccurately describes this as privatization, which is when government divests itself entirely from a current function. Contracting the function while maintaining ultimate responsibility for its provision is simply outsourcing.
  * [Stephen Smith points out][2] that when it comes to “privatization” of government parking facilities, “the ‘owners’ are barely even allowed to set their own prices, nevermind decide to use their land for, \*gasp\* something other than parking.”
  * Adam at PlayNice​.ly looks into [what’s required to establish a merchant account for credit card processing][3]. Smashing Magazine covers the same ground and [suggests a few payment processors][4]. Fundraisers should take special note of Adam’s warnings about PayPal, which may impose long-run costs hidden by its easy setup.
  * The reliably progressive StreetsBlog argues that it would be [a mistake to cut federal funding for bike paths and rail transit][5], which it argues are cost-effective. But even if a program is cost-effective, does that mean the *federal* government ought to spend money on it?
  * Last but not least, [Oregon lawmakers rick-roll the legislature](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fZi4JxbTwPo).
