What happens when the House of Representatives and Senate pass slightly different versions of the same legislation? Any schoolkid can answer that: the House and the Senate send delegates to negotiate a compromise bill.

If only it actually worked that way. All too often, the negotiators don’t split the difference during the House-Senate conference, particularly when it comes to spending. Instead, they pick the higher spending number, increase it, and call it a compromise.

Consider the funding [earmarked for intercity rail in the economic “stimulus” bill][1]. As passed, the House bill would spend $1.1 billion on Amtrak and high-speed rail, and the Senate version $3.1 billion. When negotiating the final version of the legislation, House and Senate negotiators came together and “compromised” on $9.3 billion–a figure *three times higher* than the largest amount in either bill.
