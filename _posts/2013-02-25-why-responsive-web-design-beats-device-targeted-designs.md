You should design web pages with responsive techniques instead of creating separate versions of the page for each device, Josh Byers writes. He offers three reasons to use responsive design:

  1. **It’s better for SEO.** In fact, Google specifically recommends that you have only one version of each page.
  2. **It’s easier to maintain.** You don’t have to make changes across several versions of a page, and you don’t have to create separate versions for each new device.
  3. **It offers a better reading experience.** If you follow a mobile-first design philosophy, your content is optimized automatically for all devices.
