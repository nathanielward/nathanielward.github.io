[Brian Clark at Copyblogger has the scoop][1]:

> Long copy works, because people want as much benefit-oriented information as they personally need to make the purchase.
> 
> Some won’t read much of it before buying. Others will read every word.
> 
> The key is to make the presentation of this information — your copy and the visual elements of the page — context appropriate. It needs to look and feel like your audience expects content from you to look and feel…
> 
> If you try to throw garish colors, exclamation points, and yellow highlighter at your audience when that’s not what they expect to see, you lose. In more ways than one.
