  * [Congressmen Living High on the Taxpayer Dime.][1] 
  * [An Economist’s Take on Big-Government Health Care.][2] “What is curious is that this rise in education costs is deemed by the liberal establishment smart and farsighted while the rise in health-care costs is a curse to be stopped at any cost. What is curiouser still is that in education, where they always advocate more ‘investment,’ past increases have gone hand-in-hand with demonstrably deteriorating outcomes. The rising cost in health care has been accompanied by clearly superior results. Thus we would shift dollars from where they do a lot of good to an area where they don’t.”
  * [Conservatives and Support Public Transportation][3] “The most important thing that a liberal needs to know in talking to conservatives about public transportation is not to use liberal arguments. You can’t argue for transit on the basis that the poor need it.”
