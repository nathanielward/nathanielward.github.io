> You might remember the [[do a barrel roll]][1] Easter Egg which rotates Google’s search results page. The query is so popular that it’s the first suggestion when you type “do a” and Google Instant automatically shows the results for [do a barrel roll] and triggers the Easter Egg… This is an example of [an] Easter Egg that disrupts the user experience and makes Google Search more difficult to use.
