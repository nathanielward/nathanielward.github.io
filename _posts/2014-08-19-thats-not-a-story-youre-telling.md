Marketers should tell stories. That’s the best way to engage our customers. But too often, we create content that’s not a story—there’s no protagonist, no drama.

[Paul VanDeCar elaborates][1]:

> But the “stories” on their websites weren’t so much stories as statements of feeling or timelines or sequences of events. Those all have their place, but they’re not stories, and they typically don’t grab people in the way stories do.
