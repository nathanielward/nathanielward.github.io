  * [He’s Barack Obama!][1] In their latest high-quality video, JibJab pokes fun at the President.
  * [Treason!][2] Paul Krugman says it’s “treason against the planet” to argue against legislation, laden with special-interest handouts, that would raise taxes during a recession and not accomplish its principal goal of lowering carbon emissions.
  * [A Contrarian Take on Honduras.][3] “It’s not surprising that chavistas throughout the region are claiming that he was victim of a military coup. They want to hide the fact that the military was acting on a court order to defend the rule of law and the constitution, and that the Congress asserted itself for that purpose, too.”
  * [The National Debt Road Trip][4]
