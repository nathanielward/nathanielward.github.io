[Window-shopping isn’t what it used to be][1], Philip Kennicott explains in the *Washington Post*. In an effort to maximize shelf space, all too many D.C. retailers like CVS block their windows, which reduces engagement with passers-by. I wonder: have retailers ever tested whether an engaging, inviting storefront might improve sales and offset revenues from lost shelving? ([via GGW][2]).

Ross Douthat says Kentucky Senate candidate Rand Paul is a prime example of 

[why politicians must exercise prudence in addition to principle][3]. Julian Sanchez [makes a similar point][4]: “Libertarians need to think harder about how our principles should degrade elegantly, how they can guide us through a fallen world where the live political options seldom afford a full escape from injustice.”

Michael Perkins argues that [federal workers shouldn’t get effectively unlimited mass-transit benefits][5], and suggests instead a benefit that can be spent on any form of transportation. But why stop there? Why not eliminate the benefit altogether and increase salaries accordingly, allowing workers to spend their incomes as they see fit? Not only would this remove the distortions Perkins rightly decries, but it would free workers to choose their own spending priorities.

This *Washington Post* headline raised hopes, but only briefly, that President Obama had proposed spending cuts: “[Democrats cautious on Obama’s spending-cut proposal][6].” Alas, it refers only to the President’s (important) assertion of budgetary authority—but not to any evidence that he plans any actual reduction in outlays.

And last but not least, [Arizona Gov. Jan Brewer has released a clever ad poking fun at many prominent critics of her state’s immigration law](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O6qEQ-KnitQ).
