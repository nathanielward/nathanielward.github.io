The adage “learn from your mistakes” is a bit misleading, Mig Reyes argues. [Instead of trying to fail, we should just *try*][1]:

> The makers of our world would be better off mimicking scientists with their work. Harp on deliberate practice. Reinvent their processes daily. Share every discovery. And most importantly, try new things often…
> 
> When everything’s an experiment, you shed the fear that comes with trying new things.

Consistent experimentation is the key to success, [whether in marketing][2] or any other field.
