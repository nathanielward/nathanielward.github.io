# Hey there! I'm an online marketer and fundraiser living in Washington, D.C.

I love understanding *why people make decisions*---why they say yes to an offer or unsubscribe from an email or make a purchase.

I'm fascinated by psychology and *how technology and experimentation can help us understand people better*. This helps us marketers communicate better with each person we reach.

These are the subjects of my frequent talks on online marketing and optimization, including at the Marketing Sherpa Optimization Summit, the Nonprofit Innovation and Optimization Summit, the Bridge Conference, and the Direct Marketing Association Nonprofit Conference.

Most of the time, I can be found at the Leadership Institute, where I oversee online fundraising and drive marketing optimization.
